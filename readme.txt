Semi-automated Modular Programming Construction (MPC)

****************************************************************************
REQUIREMENTS:
 - You must have JAVA runtime installed on your computer (https://java.com/en/download/).
 - You must have JSim (http://www.physiome.org/jsim/) downloaded and installed on your computer to make use of the model code generated by MPC.
****************************************************************************

Directories:
 ../examples/ --> Contains short examples and example from submitted paper at F1000Research to get you started.

 ../lib/ --> java jar file (requires Java 1.8 or higher runtime to execute) containing all of the MPC java classes (used to run the examples).

 ../src/ --> java src files for MPC program.


-- Run examples (linux example):
   If MPC is installed in ~/Desktop/MPC/, 
   from the command line, with working directory of ~/Desktop/MPC/examples, 
   use the following command:

   1.)  'java -jar ../lib/MPC.jar example.mpc'

   This generates a JSim '.mod' ('example.mod') file that can added to a JSim project file:
   2.) 'jsim -f example.mod', then save new project file as needed.
   
   NOTE: currently, Working dir must be set to loction of .mpc file.


*****************************************************************************
-- Build from source, requires a Java jdk be installed on your computer. (linux example below):
 1. Create a build directory: mkdir buildDir
 2. cd to the MPC java source file dir.
 2. javac -d buildDir *.java   <-- compile code into a package 'ModConstruct'
 3. cd buildDir/
 4. jar cvfm MPC.jar ../manifest.mf ModConstruct
added manifest
adding: ModConstruct/(in = 0) (out= 0)(stored 0%)
adding: ModConstruct/MPC.class(in = 3468) (out= 2001)(deflated 42%)
adding: ModConstruct/Get.class(in = 5687) (out= 3111)(deflated 45%)
adding: ModConstruct/Replace.class(in = 5910) (out= 3430)(deflated 41%)
adding: ModConstruct/SetGlobalVal.class(in = 2520) (out= 1431)(deflated 43%)
adding: ModConstruct/Collect.class(in = 3412) (out= 1823)(deflated 46%)
adding: ModConstruct/RemoveDup.class(in = 2447) (out= 1398)(deflated 42%)
adding: ModConstruct/CompressDir.class(in = 2378) (out= 1310)(deflated 44%)

 5. Now can run MPC program w/ jar file and .mod and .mpc files:
    java -jar MPC.jar example.mpc
